Data stored in system memory by software is generally not in a format suitable for storage on disk or transmission over a network. Serializa‚Äê tion is the process of flattening and packing data into a standard format that a reader will be able to decode. Serialization formats provide a standard of data exchange. We might encode data in a row-based manner as an XML, JSON, or CSV file and pass it to another user who can then decode it using a standard library. A serialization algorithm has logic for handling types, imposes rules on data structure, and allows exchange between programming languages and CPUs. The serialization algorithm also has rules for handling exceptions. For instance, Python objects can contain cyclic references; the serialization algorithm might throw an error or limit nesting depth on encountering a cycle.
