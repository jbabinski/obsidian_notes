### Data preparation
1. Upload data
   ![[Pasted image 20230314150654.png]]
2. Feature engineering - processing data so it can be used by model
   - factor that contributes to prediction, (independent variable, column)
   - Feature Store

### Model training
1. Model training 
2. Model evaluation

Supervised vs. unsupervised training

### Model evaluation
- evaluation metrics - confusion matrix, recall & precision
- feature importance

Confusion matrix
![[Pasted image 20230314152046.png]]

Recall = TP / (TP+FN) - how many positive cases were predicted correctly
Precision = TP / (TP + FP) - how many cases marked as positive are actually positive
Trade-off between recall and precision

Feature importance - bar chart of features, based on their impact to model prediction
